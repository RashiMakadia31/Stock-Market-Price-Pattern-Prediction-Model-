# LSTM-Based Stock Price & Pattern Prediction

**Stock Market Price Pattern Prediction Model** is a Python-based deep learning model built using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks to predict stock prices and detect technical patterns. It leverages historical stock data, technical indicators, and deep learning to make future price forecasts and recognize formations like **rounding bottoms** and **up flag patterns**.

## Features

* **Stock Price Prediction** using LSTM models trained on historical closing prices
* **Candlestick Charting** with moving average overlays (5, 13, 25-day EMAs)
* **Pattern Detection** for:

  * **Rounding Bottoms** (long-term bullish reversal)
  * **Up Flag Patterns** (short-term bullish continuation)
* Two versions of the LSTM model:

  * **Model 1**: Full-featured with early stopping
  * **Model 2**: Lightweight variant with Huber loss
* üìà Visualizations for predictions vs. actuals and training history
* ‚öôÔ∏è Modular code structure: easy to adapt for any stock ticker


## Tech Stack

* **Language**: Python
* **Libraries**:

  * `yfinance`, `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `plotly`
  * `scikit-learn`, `tensorflow`, `keras`
  * `mplfinance`, `scipy`
